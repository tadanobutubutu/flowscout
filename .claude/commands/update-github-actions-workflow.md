# /update-github-actions-workflow

Use this workflow when working on **update-github-actions-workflow** in `flowscout`.

## Goal

Update or fix GitHub Actions workflow YAML files to adjust CI/CD behavior, triggers, or formatting commands.

## Common Files

- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-agent.yml`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Edit one or more files in .github/workflows/ (e.g., build.yml, deploy-pages.yml, release-agent.yml)
- Optionally update related config files or scripts if needed
- Commit with a message referencing workflow, build, deploy, or release

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
